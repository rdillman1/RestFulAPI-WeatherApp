Started project 
Began with a design template
designed a spash screen

## 03/27/2021
Worked on the next step the log in method
created a java class for the login activity

researched how to do it through android developer. 

got it working!
confirmed I could login and on login was able to launch mainactivity


## 04/01/2021
developed the main screen implemented a spinner class for a main menu. 
Organized main class to prepare for weather API pull over
cleaned up the xml document

I think the main menu / main activity looks so good!

## 04/12/2021
Continued learning how to implement API for metaweather. 
developed an Service to do the leg work for the api response. 
got it working with a command in the menu to pull city ID from city name 

develeloped a location service that picked up locality. (city)
got it to pull during the splach activty then passes it all the way to main activity and displays it for the user
also got the main to display the persons google name. 
Main Activity is looking great!

## 04/14/2021 API integrations
Contineud with api integrations I got the whole consolidated weather report for today pulling through in a whole Toast!!!
This was a huge moment for me! 
After this i setup a few extra menu options
Refresh which is just offering the abiltiy to reload the mainactivity page
Change location > to allow the user to select a city other than the one pulled by location service!
and logout which will log the user out of the google auth throguh firebase and allow the user to pick another account. 

## 05/05/2021 Finsihing touches
Developed another screen to display a weather for a specific date
Unfortunately I could not get this to work due to the fact the Json array is unamed. 
After some time I was able to adjust the code enough to get it to work 
added some cleaning to the login activity and wahlah
